# 📈 Scaling to 100+ Users

Once you have 20 happy beta users, it's time to automate growth.

## 1. Niche Verticalization
Stop being "AI for everyone." Become "The AI Receptionist for Dental Clinics."
- Build a specific landing page for that niche.
- Use industry-specific terminology in your AI prompts.

## 2. Cold Email Outreach
- Use tools like Apollo.io or Instantly.ai to find 1,000 leads in your chosen niche.
- Send a personalized video of the AI answering a call *specifically for their industry*.

## 3. Referral Engine
- Offer your current 20 users a "1 month free" credit for every business they refer.
- Small business owners talk to each other. Leverage that.

## 4. Ads Strategy (The "Wait" Rule)
- **DO NOT** run ads until you have $1k in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).
- Once you do, run **Retargeting Ads** on Meta/Google for people who visited your site but didn't sign up.
