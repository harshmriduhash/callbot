# 🎯 Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy: CallBot AI

## Core Strategy: Inbound-Led Outbound
CallBot is a high-demonstration product. People need to *hear* it to believe it. Our strategy focuses on "Magic Moments" where potential customers interact with the AI in a real-world scenario.

### 1. Target Audience
- **Primary**: Local Service SMBs (Restaurants, Dentists, Salons, HVAC, Law Firms).
- **Pain Point**: Lost revenue from missed calls and high cost of receptionists.
- **Value Prop**: "The AI Staff Member that Never Sleeps."

### 2. Positioning
- **Not a "Bot"**: Position as a digital employee.
- **Premium but Accessible**: High-end voice quality (ElevenLabs) at a fraction of a human's salary.

### 3. Channels
- **LinkedIn/Twitter**: Build in public (technical and business milestones).
- **Local SEO/DMs**: Target businesses with "claimed" but poorly managed Google Maps profiles.
- **Niche Communities**: Facebook groups for small business owners.
