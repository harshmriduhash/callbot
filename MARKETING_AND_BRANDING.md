# ✨ Marketing & Branding Strategy

## 1. Brand Identity: "The Invisible Employee"
Your brand should feel professional, reliable, and "always-on."
- **Voice**: Helpful, efficient, and slightly tech-forward. 
- **Visuals**: Clean, dark-mode (premium), using the "C" logo you have.

## 2. Content Pillars
- **The "Magic" Demo**: Post a video of the AI handling a difficult customer request.
- **The "ROI" Story**: "How [Business] saved $200 and 10 hours last week using CallBot."
- **The "Behind the Scenes"**: Show you (the founder) fixing a challenge or building a new feature.

## 3. Marketing Spend Advice
- **Phase 1 (Day 1-30)**: $0. Spend time, not money. DM, Email, Walk-ins.
- **Phase 2 (Day 30-45)**: $500 total. Use this for a high-quality demo video production and maybe $10/day on highly targeted LinkedIn ads.
- **Phase 3 (Post-Launch)**: 20% of revenue. Reinvest into growth once the math works ($1 spent = $3 earned).
